# Time-Sculptor
Overview
In today's digital age, both Android and iPhone devices come equipped with built-in screen time tracking. Additionally, there's a surge in apps designed to aid focus. Recognizing the central role that time plays in both these contexts, 
I introduce Time Sculptor. My app not only tracks your screen time but also incorporates the Pomodoro Technique to boost your concentration.
